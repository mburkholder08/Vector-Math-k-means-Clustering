# Vector Math and K-Means Clustering
Question 1 takes a deep dive into vectorized math in both R and python. It solves generic equations, implementing timing and seeding using numpy.

Question 2 focuses on clustering via simple algorithms. Using a k-means approach, we can see where the data is best clustered.
